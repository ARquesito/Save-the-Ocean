# Save-the-Ocean
We were inspired by the off-handed thought of cute animals during our initial project discussions. We wanted to create an animal-focused project at first and then while researching landed upon pollution and the effects it has on sea animals and the ocean. The goal of the game is to bring awareness to the effects pollution has on the ocean and marine life in a cute and fun format. This game takes user input from the keyboard and uses this input to output the movement of the trash bag onto the screen. It then increases the score if trash was successfully collected by the player and decreases the score if they fail and accounts for each piece of lost trash in a lost trash score. Every 1000 points a fact is displayed onto the screen with all the facts being centered around ocean pollution. At 5000 points the user wins and is then asked if they would want to play again. In the case that the player's lost trash score exceeds 100 before hitting the win condition they are faced with a game over screen and a change in background.
